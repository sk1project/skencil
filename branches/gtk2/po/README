This directory contains the message catalogs for Sketch in the format
for gettext.

Translations are managed by the Translation Project [1]. If you want to
contribute a translation please contact the translation project about
this (most likely you need to become a member of a language team [2]).


Notes for Translators
---------------------

- Many of the messages are templates for messages that will when
  displayed on the screen contain additional information such as the
  width and height of a rectangle or a filename. These templates have
  either a % followed by either a single letter (most often s or d) or a
  word in parentheses possibly followed by another word in square
  brackets (both styles won't be mixed in a single message).

  If the template contains only the single letter variant, don't change
  the order in which they appear. In the other variant you can change
  the order in which the individual %-items appear, but don't translate
  the words in the parentheses or brackets.

  Examples:

  untranslated string           possible translation
  "Cannot find file %s."        "Kann Datei %s nicht finden."
  "Rotate by %(angle)[length]"  "Um %(angle)[length] drehen"

  For the most part these format templates are a builtin feature of
  Python and they're documented in [3]. The square brackets are a
  Sketch-specific extension.

- Use 'make mo' to create the compiled catalogs that are used at run
  time. These .mo files are created under ../Resources/Messages/.


Notes for Developers
--------------------

If you want to rebuild the sketch.pot file from scratch, you need the
pot-utils from http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/po-utils/, because
they understand Python syntax sufficiently. GNU xgettext will not work
anymore as of Sketch 0.6.6.
